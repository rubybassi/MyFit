# MyFit - The Daily Workout Tracker

## Description
For this project I was tasked with creating a workout tracker using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and Express. The front end code in the `Develop` folder was already provided.

The application allows the user to
  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan
  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan
  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page
  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page

### User Story

> As a **user**, I want to **be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.**.
